# InnoHangmanBot
This project was intended to help my learn Java, although moving from C# to Java was no problem!

I built the bot using JDA, creating my own automatic dependency injection system, service-locator and JDA interaction system. Since my previous Discord bot experience is in C# with Discord.NET I decided to create an interaction system for JDA that was like Discord.NET, it's not quite complete but I hope to make it more complete over time and possibly release it properly.

If you want to use the bot, it is hosted and should be running. You can invite the bot to your server here: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1218936835506573433&permissions=326417599488&scope=bot+applications.commands
